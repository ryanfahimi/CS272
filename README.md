# CS 272: Software Development with Code Review

This repository contains code from CS 272 at the University of San Francisco.

The course focused on building a scalable, multi-threaded **search engine** in Java. Students developed the project incrementally through weekly milestones and one-on-one code reviews, covering:
- Thread-safe inverted indexing and parallel search
- Web crawling and a dynamic servlet-based search interface
- Software design, testing, and refactoring best practices

Coursework included targeted homework assignments on logging, file I/O, multithreading, and modular design.
